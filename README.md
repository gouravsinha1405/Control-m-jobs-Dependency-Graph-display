### - I built a Django application that uses recursion to show dependent child processes based on parent process.
### - This is kind of a framework that can be utilised to visualise any process and their dependencies along with details that have the n-ary tree structure.
### - I cannot upload the whole project here but I have uploaded the demo video.
